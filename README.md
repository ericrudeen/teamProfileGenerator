# Description

This project was to further extend the skills we learned in last weeks homework, readmegenerater, into a team profile generator. Node.js prompts the user about information about employees that a user wants to input into the system. After the system takes all of the employee information, it writes the information into an HMTL file to display on a webpage. 

Here is the video walkthrough of the project:

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab

WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
